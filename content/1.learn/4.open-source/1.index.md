# Open Source


### About 

A few of the current challenges that I've identified (and have been echoed by others) are around lack of ecosystem/infrastructure support and the high bar for contributing to official Metaflow repositories within the Netflix organization. 

Making it easier to contribute and have ownership in Metaflow would go a long ways to improving the health of the OSS project by increasing the number of vocal supporters (e.g. contributors), reduce the friction / increase agency in managing Metaflow for ops teams, and benefiting new Metaflow users through the addition of tools that directly target their experience.

There are obvious tradeoffs involved here, especially with open source infrastructure projects, but these are navigatable through the maturity-level in which projects get released as OSS. Using the examples below, _**CDK / CDKTF Construct Libraries**_ and _**Custom Projen Projects**_ would have a much, much higher bar than _**Metaflow MCP Server**_. This is due to the obvious reasons of non-familiarity with the toolchain ([projen](https://projen.io/) and Typescript), as well as the APIs need to be close to 1.0 stable before opening it up.  

(Projects using the core construct libraries can be open sourced immediately)


This is demonstrated by the quality difference in the following projects:

- [generative-ai-cdk-constructs](https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-cdk-constructs): primitives and higher-level constructs for genai, stable API providing integration across aws services
- [cdk-eks-blueprints](https://github.com/awslabs/cdk-eks-blueprints): providing primitives for packaging add-ons, configurable for new / existing clusters 
- [automate-mlops-personalize-cdk-pipeline](https://github.com/aws-samples/automate-mlops-personalize-cdk-pipeline): simple construct library as a one-off


### Paired Video Content

Open source projects would not have any video content type associated with it officially (no requirement like other content). However, depending on community feedback I can see different video content working week with OSS:

- _**Walkthrough**_: This type has the highest risk, especially if the project is actively being developed, but can see walkthrough content being valuable if regularly updated (maj release / new feature) and if the project is popular enough to warrant the effort.
- _**Panel Discussion**_: Panels could be interesting to scope new projects, show how a project is being used out in the wild (e.g. `Metaflow MCP Server`), or gain feedback on existing features / solicit new functionality. This would be especially useful for infrastructure-based projects like `CDK / CDKTF Construct Libraries` and `Custom Projen Projects`
- _**1:1 Conversation**_: Useful for introducing a project using the Teacher / Student archetypes in conversation. Would cover the high-level purpose of the project and demonstrate APIs that are not likely to change often (e.g. `Create-Metaflow-App`, `Flow Builder`)
- _**Series**_: A regular series where a community member drives a simple new feature / performs a PR review etc. could be a lot of fun. Can alternatate between a scoping session -> implementation -> review for the new feature.

### Custom Layout / Markdown Components (MDC)

I really like the components that [Nuxt has for integrations](https://nuxt.com/modules?category=Libraries), discoverability is excellent with the search / card functionality being absolutely seamless (and a rudimentary version of this is already done in the [projects page](/projects), but the inspiration for this was Vueuse not the nuxt website) :

I also love the detail page, showing contributors + recency detail:

![](/content/learn/oss-2.png)

Each project would have its own repository + GitHub Pages website so can borrow from this heavily (for the detail page, may be silly to do right away if there are only 3 projects for the search/landing page so would have a more simple static card page)

#default

This is just a sample of possible projects that could be driven from the labs organization. The goal is to provide opportunities for community members to contribute to greenfield projects and build the ecosystem.
