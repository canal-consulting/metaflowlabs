# Patterns

### About 

This content type maps somewhat closely to the [Platform Guides on the OB docsite](https://docs.outerbounds.com/3000), but will differ significantly in terms of execution and supporting content (Deep Dives, Videos, and GitHub repositories). 

The Patterns content will be narrowly focused and incorporate concepts from 1-2 deep dive articles, the examples below showcase this as they all have paired references from deep dive articles\* and will reflect real-world use cases that could be the basis of starter code for new projects that incorporate those ideas.
 

\*_besides the FastAPI example, I just included this because it demonstrates the small scope of this content type and is easy to imagine a trigger deep dive existing...so I threw it in_

### Paired Video Content

There are two main types of paired video media that I think make sense for this content type:

#### 1. Walkthrough for Narrowly Focused Patterns
For patterns where the content type is more narrowly focused on a specific use-case, like the **_S3 Client for managing Hive-style partitions automatically_** example, the only Video content that makes sense really is the `Walkthrough`. See [the video section of the learn page](/learn#video) for detail and example of this type. Since the scope of this content is minimal, the video should be sub-10 minutes and be similar to the [Outerbounds playlist on tags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEmKaTI3MG4&list=PLUsOvkBBnJBc1fcDQEOPJ77pMcE4CnNxc). 


#### 2. How-to Series for Development Patterns

These include the **_Introducing the notebook resume pattern_** example pattern below and involve development patterns that detail _how_ to effectively use Metaflow. The [Draw the Owl](/projects/draw-the-owl) project will cover this use-case, but will involve either a 1:1 with a Metaflow learner where we cover the pattern at their pace or a group of learners. I think it would be great to use the Outerbounds platform for this kind of session as there is not a lot of media available currently of it out there currently.



### Custom Layout / Markdown Components (MDC)

Discoverability is probably the second most important aspect to a site like this only behind the quality of the content itself, so consideration of how to handle this effectively is going to be a high priority. 

This entails effective content tagging and providing a layout with the right amount of information density and filter options. I particularly like this component from [Vueuse](https://vueuse.org/functions.html):

The detail page also has several MDCs that I think would be valuable in a content site, the examples below show context around changes to the function referenced in the detail page but I think having this for content itself would be valuable:
