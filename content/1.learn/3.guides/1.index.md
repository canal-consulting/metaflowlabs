# Guides

### About 

Guides are the content type that I think is the most sorely needed for growing Metaflow, and with the proper tooling and automation in place it will be possible to rapidly create Metaflow guides that maintain a high level of quality. [Jacopo's excellent write up](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/you-dont-need-a-bigger-boat) is the size and scope that I'm thinking of when it comes to guides, maybe with a bit fewer moving parts (unless it's a multipart series). 


Guides have the following qualities that distinguish themselves from Patterns:

- Standalone repository with GitHub Pages site
- Video content is not optional, see below
- Must incorporate concepts from existing Patterns, which in turn are scoped to 1-2 Deep Dives. No new concepts can be introduced without proper coverage
- Where possible, Guides should be plucked from the community (Slack, GH Issues), ripped from the headlines (e.g. interesting HN), or demonstrate internal use cases of Metaflow at OB or Labs


### Paired Video Content

Guides will have at least one piece of video media, with the `Walkthrough` type being the minimum as described in the layout section below. Additionally, guides would benefit from additional video media depending on where the idea originated from or how big of a bite it is:

- _**[Build with Me(taflow)](/projects/build-with-me)**_: Larger guide content covered from the ground up having a Metaflow learner (or learners) drive the session  
- _**1:1 Conversation**_: If originated from the community, community member drives the solution with commentary from me
- _**Panel Discussion**_: Can see this type being applicable too for certain guides, especially those demonstrating triggers 

### Custom Layout / Markdown Components (MDC)

This content type will require the most research and thought on how to present the material in an engaging and effective way for learning. I don't have a great idea of this yet but I do like how [deeplearning.io](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/) handles this:

I don't think having a notebook environment would be applicable here but having the side-by-side of videos and the content _could_ be an effective way to communicate ideas and providing reference immediately. I also like having a tutorial being split into chapters, especially for more in-depth examples like Jacopo's bigger boat repo. 

Usually there are only a number of concepts you really want to hit on with longer tutorials (see the [diataxis write up on tutorials](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/#tutorials) for reference here), so having paired content and video explanation for each of the important aspects would be a nice way to handle this (along with an overview / landing page per guide).
