# Deep Dives

<img src="/content/learn/first-pyramid.svg" width="700">

### About 

The baseline content type that will introduce concepts used in Patterns and Guides. Critically, these other content types cannot introduce concepts that do not have an associated Deep Dive. This will make sure that there is full coverage of concepts as more advanced topics are covered.

#### Avoiding Content Duplication

Since the surface area of Metaflow is so small and tidy, topics will have overlap with content from the official Metaflow docs and Outerbounds content but differ in significant ways:

- Focus will be on practical application rather than _the what_ (high level overview) and _the how_ (API usage). Deep dive content will be framed in terms of actionable tips, calling out edge cases, confusing or unintuitive (for new users) aspects of the topic, and/or give a deeper treatment of the topic in order to gain mechanical sympathy for what is going on under the hood. Some examples:
  - Metaflow documentation has an excellent resource for [Loading and Storing Data](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/data) giving an overview of the topic and demonstrating the API
  - Persistence article topics below do not overlap and are targeting best-practices (_`self` vs `metaflow.S3`_), edge cases (_Advanced Data Patterns_), and deep treatment (_Datastore, Caching & Resume_, _Local vs Remote Datastore Backends_)



### Paired Video Content

Topics and articles are partitioned in such a way to make for interesting video content for the **_1:1 Conversation_** and **_Panel Discussion_** types described in [the video section of the learn page](/learn#video). I think the _`self` vs `metaflow.S3`_ article in particular would be an interesting panel discussion since basically everyone will navigate those tradeoffs differently. Not every deep dive will receive the video treatment and will be driven by what is confusing people on slack / github issues and on consulting engagements.

### Custom Layout / Markdown Components (MDC)

[MDC](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/files/markdown#mdc-syntax) allows for the seamless integration of custom components within markdown, everything on the landing page below the hero section are examples of MDC (starting with the _Current Challenges for Growth_ component). The article list below is also an example of an MDC (_Persistence_). This provides incredible flexibility as anything that can be done in Vue can become embedded within markdown content.

#### 1. [Manim](https://www.manim.community/)

Manim would be an amazing tool for demonstrating Metaflow concepts as it provides tooling to present code progression alongside animation for the DAG. Having a custom library for these operations is a no-brainer (and Eddie is excited about this already), similar to the [ManimML project](https://github.com/helblazer811/ManimML).

#### 2. Nuxt UI + shikijs twoslash

[Nuxt UI offers a rock solid component suite](https://ui.nuxt.com/components) that can be assembled into powerful MDCs for demonstrating Metaflow concepts, especially combined with the [shikijs](https://shiki.style/) for displaying code. For example, imagine an article targeting **Migrating to Metaflow**. Here we want to show a progression of steps to take an analysis in a jupyter notebook and turn it into a flow. 

There are a number of ways to do this (one being showing a Manim animation completing the process), but one that I've thought about using @nuxt/ui components would be to combine shiki, which has excellent facilities for code highlighting, with the [Stepper component](https://ui.nuxt.com/components/stepper) from Nuxt UI:

Nuxt UI has a pro license (generous one time payment terms, funds go to Nuxt team) that offers a lot of nice components that would make creating these custom MDCs even easier, with a lot of out-of-the-box MDCs that are all over the [nuxt.com site](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction). 

([This is also a pretty nice example that would be effective as an MDC](https://www.nuppets.dev/ai-commands))

### Articles

Other deep dive articles would include series on **Configuration and Environments**, **Card Development** etc. again, this type of content is the base that Patterns and Guides will be building upon.

The example deep dive (_Datastore, Caching & Resume_) is not representative of the kind of content that will be created on site, the static images would be replaced by MDC components and the content itself would depend on the outcome of [Content Templates](/projects/content-templates) and [Tooling](/projects/content-generation-tooling)
