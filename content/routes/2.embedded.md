#### Embedded Within Outerbounds

In this path I would be an Outerbounds employee but work outside the normal engineering org structure, focusing on
the same _fundamental research_ work as the consulting engagement path, and covering the same 12-week initial project plan.


The embedded option includes the same revenue-generating activities of:

- Metaflow Consulting
- Offering Training Courses
- Paid Video Course Content

--- 
The difference in this path is _where_ the revenue from these activities is allocated. I'm optimistic that the funds
generated in this capacity would, over time, eclipse my FTE cost and hopefully represent a significant revenue stream.
Part of this arrangement would be the requirement that revenue generated from consulting/training would be earmarked
exclusively for growing the Metaflow community as a whole and not Outerbounds proper. These would include line-items for
more traditional growth such as:

- travel + sponsoring booths at conferences outside the norm such as at
  - [DBT's Coalesce](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/event/21662b38-2c17-4c10-9dd7-964fd652ab44/summary)
  - [RStudio / Posit Conf](https://posit.co/conference/)
- funding cash prizes for Metaflow hackathons (hopefully with donated / subsidized OB platform compute :))
- paying fees for technical staff (Video Editing, Animation)
- paying engaged community for guest content / high quality example repos (
  e.g. [Jacopo](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/you-dont-need-a-bigger-boat))
- paying high profile non-community members from different domains for guest content / high quality example repos (e.g.
  AWS Heros)
- consulting fees for high-profile integrations such as a greenfield R package, DBT integration
