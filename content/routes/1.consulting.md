#### Consulting

This path would be a full-time 12-week engagement to bootstrap Metaflowlabs, allowing labs to be mostly self-sufficient\* afterward through offering services from the landing page such as:

- Metaflow Consulting
- Offering Training Courses
- Paid Video Course Content

\*continuing with a performance-based fee based on OB conversions or other proxy metrics that you think makes sense.

#### Team

I have a former colleague that I'd want to include if going down this route that I'm envisioning owning the video side of content creation as well as being my foil in the 1:1 Conversation Video content type that's described in [the learn landing page](/learn#video). She was a star pupil at one of the stops where I onboarded Metaflow and would represent the `Metaflow Learner` archetype that I think is important for creating this kind of content. I'll fill you in on the identity of this mystery person is if we decide to go ahead.

I've successfully built a business from scratch that had the happy ending of being acquired with Priceflow so know what is involved and know that the chances of success grow substantially if I started with a partner rather than going solo (especially one with complementary expertise that I don't have, e.g. video production).

In this scenario I would bring her on after a lot of the preliminary work has been done to focus her time on video tooling and prep.

#### What's in it for OB

This is outlined in the landing page but will reiterate here:

- Have a complementary organization promoting Metaflow that has a direct stake in growing the community
- Greatly expand marketing reach through collaborating on releases, integrations, and in promoting events
- Partner on conference booths, organizing Metaflow events, co-promote during talks 
- Feedback from consulting activities would inform Outerbounds product, e.g. **the DBT model**
- Pipeline of warm leads for OB Platform from Labs consulting / training / courses
- Dramatically improve Metaflow SEO, especially for LLMs
