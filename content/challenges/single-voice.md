_Outerbounds is a fantastic steward of Metaflow but having only a single organization promoting the project has some issues_

- The challenges outlined above lead to the unhappy situation where the vast majority of conference talks, blogs, and tutorials all come exclusively from Outerbounds
- This hurts SEO, which is increasingly important with more powerful AI tooling for deep web search becoming widely available
- Having other organizations with a business model built around Metaflow would improve the perception of project health and support
