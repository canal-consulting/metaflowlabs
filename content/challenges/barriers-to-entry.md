_Getting to that lightbulb moment of what Metaflow can do for data scientists is more difficult than it should be_ 

- Local Metaflow development (without a remote backend) is not a good first impression to the project, especially for inexperienced users
- The tutorials have not been meaningfully updated since initial release, are not engaging for new users
- There is not much content / media available demonstrating the Outerbounds platform
