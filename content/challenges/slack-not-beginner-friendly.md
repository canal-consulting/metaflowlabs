_Slack conversations lean towards advanced use-cases/topics, intimidating all but the bravest souls_

- Conversations can easily get lost in the noise with the single #ask-metaflow channel. Longer discussions typically lean
  more towards the advanced topics, unintentionally scaring off new users.
- The single channel negatively affects the searchability of the content, and makes it difficult to find answers to
  questions and leading to more repeated questions being asked
- Lack of channels make it less likely for community members to contribute answers and build domain ownership (e.g.
  pinned messages/files)
- I regularly have data scientists DMing me directly instead of asking questions publicly, these sidebar conversations
  are not searchable/discoverable for others.
