*State of infrastructure support for OSS Metaflow turns off ops teams, I have heard this personally several times at different orgs*

- Independent deployability is a key factor when evaluating any new technology; Metaflow not having a seamless experience absolutely hurts adoption and lowers confidence in the project
- Only most basic examples exist in the terraform module repository, long turnaround for feature requests
- No examples interfacing Metaflow infrastructure with external events
