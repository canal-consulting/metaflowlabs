_Metaflow is effectively a monorepo, hard for people to initially engage with such a mature and fairly opinionated project with so much history_ 


Despite this, there is tremendous opportunity in growing the community through fostering an ecosystem around:

- Creating sharable flows, extensions (e.g. rock-solid single purpose composable flows, like slack or message queue integrations)
- Hub for flows, plugins and starter templates representing best-practices for common patterns
- OpenAPI tooling to allow for easy integration with non-python clients, automatic documentation through swagger, and deployment directly from the spec
