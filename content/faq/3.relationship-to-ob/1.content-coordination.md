Having a separate entity to announce new **OB features**, with **high-quality content** and **example repository projects**, will amplify the marketing impact tremendously for Outerbounds. Having staggered releases of content, such as the following, generates a continual stream that would greatly boost SEO over a single announcement post:
1.  **OB feature announcement**
2.  **Metaflowlabs blog post**
3.  **Metaflowlabs Repository**
4.  **OB YouTube** etc.

This material can be ready to go well ahead of time so this coordination would be easy to do and benefit both entities.
