Following the **DBT model**, where they had a significant consulting arm up until recently, Metaflowlabs consulting and community engagement will provide a steady stream of feedback that is currently unavailable to Outerbounds. This works in the other direction as well, where consulting clients' needs that would be met by current **OB features** (e.g., observability features of **OB** through **OpenTelemetry**) would be natural **upsell opportunities**. As was the case with **DBT**, the consulting arm will likely drive business to the **platform** automatically.
