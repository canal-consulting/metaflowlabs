All **Pattern** and **Guide** content (map to Diataxis How-to and Tutorial types) will be accompanied by repositories that will be available on GitHub when published. These repositories will be created from an **IaC construct lib** to ensure consistency based on the type, and will at least include a published **GitHub Pages site** and a **revealjs presentation**. Metaflowlabs will also build and maintain dedicated **infrastructure** repositories to support/extend the existing **Metaflow Terraform modules**.
