Content will closely follow the [**_Diataxis framework_**](https://diataxis.fr/), consisting of:

- In-depth treatment of foundational concepts.
- How-to guides that are immediately actionable.
- Deep-dive tutorials covering a range of real-world use cases.

This material will **supplement rather than duplicate** the official docs and Outerbounds resources. The goal will be to provide *3Blue1Brown*-level of quality (not in the use of Manim as an education tool, but in terms of clarity and focus).
