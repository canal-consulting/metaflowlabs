Metaflowlabs will produce several regular series of video content [examples here](/learn#video) aimed at showing Metaflow in action. These series will include:

- Video supplements to all three content types.
- Series pairing with community members on common problems.
- Building non-trivial Metaflow projects over several episodes.
- Hosting panel discussions on different aspects of using Metaflow in the wild.

These series would also be an excellent opportunity to showcase the **OB platform** in action.
