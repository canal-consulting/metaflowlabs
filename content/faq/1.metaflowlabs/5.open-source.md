Projects would allow community to contribute to new, greenfield projects. These could include:

- Reusable infrastructure in the form of **Terraform modules**. These would extend rather than supplant the OB maintained modules.
- **CDK constructs** providing blueprints for interfacing Metaflow with external services. Like this [typescript Metaflow construct library](https://github.com/bcgalvin/metaflow-cdk) from 4+ years ago, also [available on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/cdk-metaflow/).
- Reference architectures for common use cases (e.g., **DBT**).
- Interesting standalone projects featuring Metaflow being used in ways outside of the norm (e.g. streaming)

Other projects could include:

- Standalone libraries for bootstrapping Metaflow projects, **create-react-app** style.
- Tauri app providing a flow-builder UI for prototyping differrent architectures. Could be extended further with: 
  - LLM tooling to convert notebook to flow
  - Environment linter, checking for issues such as flows with incompatible pandas versions within steps
- Other useful tools focused on dev experience
