_Meaningful gaps in content coverage and inconsistent quality can emerge when there aren't dedicated resources available._

Having a separate entity primarily focused on generating content in support of OSS Metaflow would benefit both Metaflow.org documentation and Outerbounds.com content:


**Metaflow.org**:

- Ensure Metaflow API coverage in documentation (e.g. missing decorators): lack of coverage hurts llm-generated Metaflow code
- Coordinate on authoring [reference material](https://diataxis.fr/reference/) that documentation site is lacking or could be improved. Content that does not fit in Outerbounds or Metaflowlabs


**Outerbounds**:

- Shared use of content and IaC repository templates to maintain consistency
- Partner on content review processes to ensure quality
