Nuxt provides excellent tooling for SEO and getting LLM-ready, through the [Nuxt SEO](https://nuxtseo.com/) and [Nuxt LLMs](https://nuxt.com/modules/llms) projects. Nuxt LLMs in particular allow robots and users to extract content easily in the llms-txt format, [see the example for this site here](/llms-full.txt).


It is also possible to include the Metaflow API through [Nuxt Content's github source](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/collections/sources#repository). This could be used to pull from metaflow docs repository to include that material into the llms.txt, but not expose it on the labs site to avoid duplication. Alternatively could create a custom source that would run the Metaflow stubs command / clone and run pyright etc. Lot of flexbility here.
