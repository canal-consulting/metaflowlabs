A core component of Metaflowlabs will be ongoing community video series (tenative titles):

- [Draw the Owl](/projects/draw-the-owl)
- [Build with Metaflow](/projects/build-with-me)
- [From the Trenches](/projects/from-the-trenches)

The focus of each is on using Metaflow in a real-world capacity, and would have community members co-lead the sessions. 

There is currently a lack of content available of what the Outerbounds platform actually is, features, and what it provides over managing OSS Metaflow. These series represent an opportunity to change that by having 5-10 community members sign up for slots and have the session be run on an ephemeral OB cluster (with setup handled beforehand so the experience is seamless once we are recording).
