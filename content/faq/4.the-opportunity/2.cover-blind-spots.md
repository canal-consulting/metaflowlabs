Outerbounds have been excellent stewards of the Metaflow OSS project as a whole, but there are blind spots that could be better covered with the help of a separate entity. These include:

- **Infrastructure support** and examples for **OSS Metaflow**.
- New user content and tutorials.
- **High-quality example repositories** covering different aspects of the **DS project lifecycle**.

These are all areas where it would be a direct interest for Metaflowlabs to cover, but for reasons could conflict with the Outerbounds product roadmap. Not covering these areas hurts adoption of Metaflow in the long run, so having Metaflowlabs work on these would improve the long-term health of the project and not affect Outerbounds product development.
