The core business model will be in providing **consulting services** to targeting the **OSS Metaflow** folks in the community, with the website and other efforts hopefully leading to consistent flow of work. Will take all comers but will position these services around onboarding new orgs to Metaflow.


At a certain point, the cost of my services/retainer vs the **OB platform** will naturally lead to clients to transition to Outerbounds.
