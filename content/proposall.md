## Main Concerns Raised From Prev Conversation

- Initial timeline included 8 weeks of development prior to launch which is too long without visible deliverables
- Content creation would be impacted upon launch due to conflicts with consulting/training engagements
- Cost of 12 week engagement, $120,000 at $250/hr, is high / hard to justify without a clear path to ROI

## Updated Proposal

Fundamentally, I consider my relationship with you much more valuable than any consulting engagement so I won't deliver anything that you are not 100% happy with. The points you made were all valid, and what I am ultimately proposing is a long term partnership which makes short ROI calculations difficult, but I think the updates below should address the concerns.

### Deliverables

The scope of deliverables will be limited to areas directly show benefit to Outerbounds, so .

### Term Length


- 
- The deliverables will begin on week 5, and consist of ongoing blog posts and community series (weekly)
- The engagement will start one week after the proposal accepted, first funds delivered. This time will not be billed but used for literature review and preparation / scoping
- Will be 5 weeks at the same price, which drops to 200/hr

The hourly is not important, the total amount is as this is what I have budgeted
