## Main Concerns Raised From Prev Conversation

- Initial timeline included 8 weeks of development prior to launch which is too long without visible deliverables
- Content creation would be impacted upon launch due to conflicts with consulting/training engagements
- Cost of 12 week engagement, $120,000 at $250/hr, is high / hard to justify without a clear path to ROI

## Updated Proposal

Fundamentally, I consider my relationship with you much more valuable than any consulting engagement so I won't deliver anything that you are not 100% happy with. The points you made were all valid, and what I am ultimately proposing is a long term partnership which makes short ROI calculations difficult, but I think the updates below should address the concerns.

### Term Length: 5 (+ 1) Weeks

To start after the proposal accepted / first funds delivered. I would like to begin by having the first week be unpaid and used for prep / literature review and to make sure that the data that I would need from Outerbounds is available. The first contracted week would begin immediately after, with deliverables landing in week 5. Extending to 5 weeks would not increase the total cost of engagement, effectively reducing the hourly rate to $200/hr.

I am not really concerned with the hourly rate here, so we can extend beyond the 12 total weeks if doing so is better for you. The 120k number is what I landed on to pursue this factoring in opportunity cost and several months of ramp up time for the generating income any from Metaflowlabs.

### Deliverables

The scope of deliverables for this initial engagement will be limited to areas directly show benefit to Outerbounds, while also being aligned with the roadmap for Metaflowlabs. This means that it will _not_ include any work on the Metaflowlabs website, any automation etc., and will focus on content creation and community engagement. 

The deliverables will consist of three main components, so that all [4 content types get covered](/learn):

- **Guide**
  - An in-depth guide on a topic TBD, that will be selected based on the analysis of the slack data (or chosen by OB team). This will be released as a blog post + repository as described in the [guides page](/learn/guides).
  - Side effects of producing the guide-level content will be 1-2 patterns and 2+3 deep dives, which can be released as blog posts (see [patterns page](/learn/patterns) and [deep dives page](/learn/deep-dives)).
  - There will be no video content as described in those pages + this content will be reused later in the Metaflowlabs website, with MDC components, etc.
- **Open Source**
  - A release of an open source tool or library that can be a new tool (such as described in this [slack thread with Eric](https://outerbounds-community.slack.com/archives/C02116BBNTU/p1749685788839179)), or a public release of something existing that I've worked on previously, such as several cdk/cdktf constructs relating to Metaflow or [something referenced here](/learn/open-source#projects)
  - This will provide an outlet for people in the community to contribute, especially enthusiastic slack users like Eric and Jon Daniels and others.
- **Community Series** 
  - Starting in week 5, this will be a TBD bi-weekly (to start) series, probably cycling through different topics and formats until solidifying by the time Metaflowlabs is launched.

From week 5 onwards, we could then continue with a regular cadence of content releases and hosted community series that are generated from subsequent engagements. This would allow you to get the feedback of the early release and also allow me to steadily increase my involvement with the community.

In addition to the above visible deliverables, I will also possibly include these projects:

- [proxy metric generation](/projects/proxy-metric-generation): Probably done during the prep week, but this is critical to get the pre-treatment data to measure progress as I step up my involvement with labs.
- [slack analysis / reporting](/projects/slack-analysis): The result of this will inform the content roadmap, and possibly the initial selection of the guide topic. This can get pushed to later if it seems like the scope is already too large.

### Follow-up Engagements

Following our conversation, I think it would make sense for the follow-up engagements to have the following milestones:

- **Launch of Metaflowlabs**
- **Launch of Consulting/Training Services**

This way the consulting/training services cannot conflict with content creation until the full term. This will also allow me to continue to focus on managing / getting goodwill with the community through regular content releases and community series (and possibly some open source work) until the launch of the consulting/training services.
