## Background

Metaflowlabs is premised on the following hot takes that I have developed over the last ~7 years through
managing Metaflow infrastructure, onboarding orgs to Metaflow, teaching data scientists how to use Metaflow, overall
thinking about Metaflow:

- There is demand from the community for high quality Metaflow content and examples
- There is an increasing number of credible alternative open source projects that overlap with Metaflow
- The lack of high quality content and real-world example projects hurts adoption of Metaflow vs these credible alternatives
- There exists possible conflicts for Outerbounds to produce certain types of content and examples

The last point deserves a bit of clarification. I'm currently
reading [The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation](https://www.amazon.com/Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovation/dp/0143122797/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dZIV-k0vw9usKuoTVml5tS3kxHQnQ1EU7XRjuSqNoP9YKVS2UcKyQjgMx_sNpidcPCaKzDVgkfohnzFBefxzx_YB7vK0gC-MziuAmtPtOLY.E4_hoqFoQKSUtefESUfmdFM5d3e0dM1MHQ8eEEbr4gQ&dib_tag=se&hvbmt=%7BBidMatchType%7D&hvdev=c&keywords=bell+labs+the+idea+factory&qid=1748855019&s=books&sr=1-1),
and while the parallel may be a bit of a stretch I'm going to try to make it work. The magic of Bell Labs
was in that organizations ability to perform fundamental research (including the S language by John Chambers, which
became R); and its downfall was in large part due to shifting its focus away from long-term, fundamental research toward
short-term, product-driven development.

The connection I am attempting to make is that Outerbounds, while being amazing stewards of Metaflow, has a disincentive to spend scarce
resources on activities that only target the growth of the OSS project, such as beginner content or infrastructure example projects, when
there are competing demands for new feature development or content targeting the OB platform, that more directly generate revenue.

#### "Fundamental Research"

To be clear, I'm not saying this is a bad thing in any way, it is just the reality of building a business on open source. The idea that I'm banking on here is that having a separate entity focused exclusively on building the community can be a lucrative endeavour on its own, while also having the happy side effect of greatly benefiting Outerbounds at the same time.

## Deliverables

The [/projects page](/projects) outlines a possible roadmap (although I haven't written the individual task descriptions yet since that scoping will require your input), this is not broken out as sprint tasks per-se but at a higher level to illustrate the type of work I'm thinking about. That being said, although I target 12 weeks to launch, I want to call out that there are a number of deliverables over that span that would benefit Outerbounds along the way:

1. [Slack Analysis and Reporting](/projects/slack-analysis): Would be initial EDA and further analysis on the OB slack data, followed by ETL w dashboard or other tooling if warranted. This analysis would help inform labs content and how to [partition #ask-metaflow on launch](/projects/slack-restructuring)
2. [Repository Automation](/projects/repository-automation): This is IaC for quickly bootstrapping new repository examples, reducing the steps as much as possible to go from **"saw this cool python thing on HN"** to **"here's the repository for that cool thing using Metaflow"**.
3. [Metaflowbot](/projects/metaflowbot): Idea is that this should be available before launch for testing using one of the more mature and documented bots as a starting point, such as [wandbot](https://github.com/wandb/wandbot)


Again, the projects list is just one possible roadmap and can be adjusted to include deliverables that benefit OB more directly.

## Paved Paths

I want my next career step to involve working on Metaflow full-time in some capacity since it's been such a central part 
of my career. In that time I've onboarded Metaflow at 4 different orgs, supported dozens of data scientists through 100+ 1:1s on 
their Metaflow projects. 

Based on that experience, I think the highest-leverage activity for me is around this _fundamental
research_ aspect and growing the community through the kind of work I've outlined throughout this resource. Presented
below are just two possible paths for that:
