- Interesting Slack questions get deep dives
- Meet with slack user, over 1-2 sessions and identify the issue and help them with a solution
- Write up the solution and experience on metaflowlabs.com
- Publish update to repository that isolates the issue and uses quarto for website/revealjs automation
- Do a YT video with slack user where we go over issue and solution, take questions
