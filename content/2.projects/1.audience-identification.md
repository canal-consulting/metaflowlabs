This requires some more thought, idea came from Metaflow not having any presence on Twitter -> what other channels exist where meaningful conversations in the domain are happening? Where do the influential hang out? 

Output of this would be analysis of 

Channels:

- twitter
- other slack chan/discord servers (rands, dbt, others?)

Archetype / Personas:

- "influencers" in domain


Data sources?

- Ask HN post
- Rands
- others?
