This is a critical project that affects many downstream:

- [Slack Restructuring](/projects/slack-restructuring)
- [Metaflowbot](/projects/metaflowbot)
- [Content Templates](/projects/content-templates)
- [Generate initial content](/projects/write-guides-deep-dives)

This will produce the partitions for the slack restructuring and will be critical for informing initial content.

Analysis should be put into a flow + card or used to populate dashboard
