This provides the base set of metrics to gauge Metaflow OSS community health / growth. 



[Apache Dev Lake is a place to start](https://devlake.apache.org/livedemo/OSSMaintainers/WeeklyCommunityRetro), focus more on DORA type metrics so not relevant but maybe some ideas there.


### Things I track now

- number of new repositories: not great proxy due to the barrier problem, i.e. no one can _easily_ experiment with Metaflow / companies using Metaflow won't have public repositories. 

### Possible Metrics

- articles written primarily about Metaflow across xyz channels
- articles mentioning metaflow across xyz channels (positive / negative?)
- twitter mentions (positive / negative?)
- ?
